1. Enable the server to listen for incoming WebSocket connections
2. If the server find that the first request is not a HTTP GET, it will fallback to vanilla TCP.
3. With this mod installed, a client can connect to a WebSocket-enabled server using a WebSocket URI, e.g. `ws://hostname:port/endpoint'
4. The server ignores the endpoint in the URI.
5. Clients can still connect to vanilla TCP servers using `hostname:port`
