The most simple WebSocket connection:

server IP from ip.ip.ip.ip:
wss://sni-host.com@ip.ip.ip.ip

Set sni and http hostname differently, resolve server IP from host.com:
wss://sni.com:@host.com[:port]

Set sni and http hostname differently, resolve server IP from sni.com:
wss://:host.com@sni.com[:port]
